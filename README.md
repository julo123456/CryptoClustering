# CryptoClustering
## This is a project task to perform Unsupervised Machine Learning
### Tools: Python 
### Unsupervised Machine Learning Methodology:
#### Step 0- Data Prep
Use the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data
#### Step 1- K-Mean Clustering
A for loop to find the best KMean value; in addition to using KMeans() function to get a model.
#### Step 2- Principal Component Analysis (CPA)
pca.fit_transform() function was utilized to compress normalized data from step 0.
